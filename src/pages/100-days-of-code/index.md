Starting today, 24.12.2018 (üéÖüèª), I‚Äôll be doing the [100 days of code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like: I‚Äôm committing to improving my coding skills for least 1hr a day continuously for the next 100 days.

### Why

My long-term goal is to own a successful software company. In order to do that, I need solid frontend and backend coding skills so that I can quickly develop and launch product MVPs. 

I‚Äôd love to focus on building side-projects right now but I realize that there are a few blind-spots in my coding knowledge that I should focus on eliminating first. This will also be beneficial for my actual day job as a remote marketing developer.

I‚Äôve been doing a decent job of studying these past few weeks but I haven‚Äôt been as consistent as I want to be. I‚Äôd occasionally leave out a day or only do 30 minutes. This challenge will help me stay accountable.

### What I‚Äôll be focusing on

Here are the areas I intend to focus on in the next 100 days:
* Finishing the [Advanced React & GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com) course
* React testing: I‚Äôve only done minimal testing in Javascript so far, so this is an important skill I need to work on
* [Node course](https://learnnode.com): I plan to build the backend APIs for my side-projects in Node, so I want to get more familiar with it.
* Advanced React patterns & concepts: render props, hooks, etc.
* Webpack
* CSS Grid

### How

I‚Äôll spend at least 1hr improving my coding skills every day.  I‚Äôm actually aiming to get closer to 2hr on most days but I have to be realistic that between my day job, the holidays, and other responsibilities - it might be hard to hit the 2hr mark every single day. Doing 1hr should always be possible, no matter what happens.

The main obstacles I foresee are traveling days: I will be traveling to Bali, Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia in the next 3 months. I‚Äôll need to be extra disciplined not to drop the ball on those days.

### Follow along

I‚Äôll do daily posts on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oscarjesionek/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oscarjesionek/)  updating on my progress. Follow me there if you‚Äôre interested to see how it goes. I'll be using the *#oscars100daysofcode* hashtag to mark the posts.

I‚Äôll also do updates on this blog on days 30 and 60 as well as a retrospective after the 100 days are over.
